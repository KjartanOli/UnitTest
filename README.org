* What is this
  UnitTest is a very simplistic unit testing framework for Java.  It is still in
  very early development, and is almost guaranteed to never reach usability for
  real projects. Please do not use this for actually important code.
* Usage
  A single ~UnitTest~ is a single test case, a ~TestSuite~ allows for the grouping
  of multiple tests, that can then be run with a single command.  The name
  ~TestSuite~ is pending a change, so that ~TestSuite~ can be used for another
  concept.  Expect it to change whenever I have the time to get around to it.
